# About

Hi — I'm the author of this site. This repository hosts a simple GitHub Pages site. I added a clean layout and a small stylesheet so pages are easier on the eyes.

If you'd like changes to the content, list of projects, or a richer About page (photo, timeline, CV), tell me what to include and I will add it.
