# Updates to the National Government
Following the ratification of the new Constitution, we have implemented a new government structure. This updated Constitution ensures that the Government operates more efficently, transparently, and is more fair to its citizens. This new structutre better equips us to uphold the rights of our citizens, and pass legislation to protect them. Even with these changes, Len citizens won't notice much of a change.

## What We Changed
### Overview
As we said, the new Constitution has become supreme law of Len. Any legislation previously enacted has been nullified, as most of it conflicts with the new Constitution. All new laws, and government actions must comply with the Constitution.
